# Openfreeroll

## Concept
I want to explore a bigger way to use freeroll (and similar systems) along side ethereum to help incentivize us to build better habits and achieve our goals.

## Types of contracts
1. EtherHabits (custom sizing)
2. Chained Freerolls (social / community)
3. EtherHabits (with a friend)

### EtherHabits (custom sizing)
- Deploy an etherHabit with a charity/friend as recipient
- Set amount and duration
- Check in everyday to claim your reward for that day

### Chained Freerolls (social / community)
- Start a chain with a theme, a cause and a duration (and your wager)
- Add to the chain with an equal (or larger?) wager
- Win half the prior links wager
- Have a reputation score

### EtherHabits (with a friend)
- Post a habit challenge
- Friend accepts and escrows
- You escrow and the wager starts
- Check-in daily
- Get paid in compared to your friend's check-ins
